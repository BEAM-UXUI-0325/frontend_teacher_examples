// you have three classes with students that do lessions together and simars in separate classes
// now merge the classes together and order them alphabetically and then choose 5 students at the start of the list
// and display them
// (if you want to add difficulty: choose 5 students at the end instead)
// (to make it even more harder, choose 5 students in the middle of the class)

// const class1 = ["Jack", "Tinna", "Lola"]
// const class2 = ["Jack", "Tinna", "Lola"]
// const class3 = ["Jack", "Tinna", "Lola"]
